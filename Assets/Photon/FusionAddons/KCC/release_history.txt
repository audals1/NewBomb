Photon Fusion Advanced KCC Addon - Release History

Last tested with Fusion SDK 2.0.0 RC3 Build 807

2.0.5
- Fixed projection of depenetration vector, resulting in jitter on slopes.

2.0.4
- Added [HideInCallstack] attribute to custom log methods.
- Removed [NetworkBehaviourWeaved(-1)] attribute from KCC class - this fixes TeleportRPC().

2.0.3
- Changed root namespace from Fusion.KCC to Fusion.Addons.KCC.
- Added new argument to processor suppress methods - it is now allowed to suppress processors in all future stages.
- Added support for SuppressProcessorsExcept<T>() and other similar variants - skips execution of all pending processors except processors of type T.
- Added support for suppressing processors from all future stages via method argument (default is false).
- It is now guaranteed a processor is executed only once during a stage even if it is registered in multiple collections (Local/Modifier/Collision/...).
- EnvironmentProcessor.SuppressOtherProcessors() is now protected virtual which allows applying custom suppression rules after the base stage is done.
- EnvironmentProcessor now sets KCCData.KinematicSpeed from ISetKinematicSpeed stage instead of IPrepareData.
- Fixed interpolation in PlatformProcessor.
- Minor performance optimizations.

2.0.2
- Fixed state reset on predicted proxies.
- Disabled proxy prediction/interpolation in fixed update.
- Added KCC.RestoreState() to support manual reset of state from network buffer.
- Network traffic and performance optimizations.
- Added support for Move and Rotate handles.
- Added KCC.Interpolate() methods for interpolation with custom source/timeframe/alpha.
- Interpolation now respects Object.RenderSource and Object.RenderTimeframe and uses correctly FUN/Render KCCData instances.
- KCCSettings.Processors type changed to array of UnityEngine.Object. From now any IKCCProcessor object can be linked (prefab, child object, scriptable object).
- Step-Up processor - min push-back distance required for activation can be configured on prefab.
- Step-Up processor - added option to require target surface to be walkable (angle <= KCCData.MaxGroundAngle) before the processor activates.
- Step-Up processor - added option to update collision hits with new overlap query when it is active.
- Ground-Snap processor - added option to update collision hits with new overlap query when it is active.
- Platform processor - major performance and usability improvements for platforms. The only requirement now is that the script implementing IPlatform must execute before PlatformProcessor.
- Platform processor - separated world => platform and platform => space transition durations.
- Platform processor - added support for platform rotation.
- Platform processor - execution of all scripts that implement IPlatform must happen before PlatformProcessor. This is a hard requirement to get everything smooth.
- Added ScriptableKCCProcessor - default KCC processor implementation based on ScriptableObject.
- Added NetworkTRSPProcessor - default KCC processor implementation based on NetworkTRSP.
- Added more data to StatsRecorder.
- Added comments to step-up, ground-snap and platform processors for easier implementation of custom modifications.
- Added default provider prefabs.

Version 2.0.1
- Added Force Single Overlap Query option to KCC settings. This is a performance optimization for non-player characters at the cost of lower movement quality.
- Profiler calls replaced by profiler markers.
- Performance optimizations.

Version 2.0.0
- Initial release.
